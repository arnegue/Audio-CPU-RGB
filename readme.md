# Audio - CPU - RGB
This (private created( Windows-Programm (Visual-Studio C# Project) deals with decoding/analyzing Audio-Output or CPU-Temperature, calculate RGB-Values from them and sending them via Serial to any Device (in my case a PIC-Microcontroller see: [PIC16F1825 PWM USART LED](https://bitbucket.org/arnegue/pic16f1825-pwm-usart-led))
